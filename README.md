WinMTR – Appnor's Free Network Diagnostic Tool

Thank you for downloading WinMTR v0.93!

# About

WinMTR is a free MS Windows visual application that combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping in a single network diagnostic tool. WinMTR is Open Source Software, maintained by Appnor MSP, a fully managed hosting & cloud provider.

It was started in 2000 by Vasile Laurentiu Stanimir  as a clone for the popular Matt’s Traceroute (hence MTR) Linux/UNIX utility. 

# License & Redistribution

WinMTR is offered as Open Source Software under GPL v2.

# Installation

You will get a .zip archive containing two folders WinMTR-32 and WinMTR-64.
Both contain two files: WinMTR.exe and README.TXT.
Just extract the WinMTR.exe for your platform (32 or 64 bit) and click to run it.
If you don’t know what version you need, just click on both files and see which one works ;-)
As you can see, WinMTR requires no other installation effort.

Trick: You can copy the WinMTR.exe file in Windows/System32 so it’s accessible via the command line – cmd!

## Supported platforms:
* Windows 11 latest release
* Windows 10x64 (until MS support drop)

## Best effort platforms (the maintainer doesn't have hardware, and the compiler doesn't always cooperate)
* Windows 11 on ARM

# Usage

Visual:

* Start WinMTR.
* Write the name or IP ofthe host (e.g. google.com)
* Press the Options buttonto configure ping size,maximum hops and pinginterval (the defaults areOK).
* Push the Start buttonand wait.
* Copy or export theresults in text or HTMLformat. Useful if you wantto document or file acomplaint with your ISP.
* Click on Clear History to remove the hosts you have previously traced.

Command line:

* Run winmtr.exe --help to see what are the options
* Run winmtr hostname (e.g. winmtr www.yahoo.com)

# Troubleshooting

a) I type in the address and nothing happens.

Usually this has to do with lame anti-virus or firewall applications. Stop all that when doing debugging or when using WinMTR. Or, configure them properly.

b) I get an error saying the program cannot be executed.

You are running the 64 bit version on a 32 bit platform. Try the WinMTR.exe stored in the WinMTR_x32 folder.

c) I get an error unspecified here.

Please report it to us to make sure it’s not a bug in the application.
